# Abstract

the Tempest app is meant to be useful for me, Evan Swanson, by giving me all of the weather information I find most helpful for the cities I care about. It is meant to be simple, clean, one-page, and minimal clicking. 

This project's main purpose is to be a stepping stone. Touching on all the areas I learned in Turing (CSS, React/XML, displaying fetched API data, clean user experiences, deployment...), this project's main raison d'etre is to bring my confidence level back up so I can begin making more complex apps again, as well as employing new technologies.
