# Abstract

the Tempest app is meant to be useful for me, Evan Swanson, by giving me all of the weather information I find most helpful for the cities I care about. It is meant to be simple, clean, one-page, and minimal clicking. I wanted this to be a website I actually use on my phone to check weather, so it is responsive to both mobile and desktop layouts.

This app leans on OpenWeatherMap.org's open-source weather API. It was a very intuitive, RESTful API to work with. I used a very simplistic calculation for dew point, as the API did not include it, so dew point may be slightly inaccurate. While not using React Native, I still made sure it delivered a dedicated mobile layout. The arrow images were taken from Icons8.

Besides being useful to me personally, this project's main purpose is to be a stepping stone, touching on all the areas I learned in Turing (CSS, React/XML, displaying fetched API data, clean user experiences, deployment...).
